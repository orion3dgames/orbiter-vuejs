# Orbiter VUEJS
A small personal project to test my skills and for a bit of fun :)

## Technology
I will be using
- FIREBASE (database)
- AFRAME (3d engine)
- VUEJS (ui)
- NENJI (multiplayer)

## Installation Guide
IMPORTANT: NODE V14- (any higher version are not compatible with NENGI yet)
- Clone the repository
- Open a terminal and launch these commands from the root folder
- ```yarn install``` (install client dependencies)
- ```yarn serve``` (launch a client)
- ```yarn daemon``` (launch a server)
- go to "localhost:8080" to view the game.
